			<h2 class="date">04 April 2020</h2>
			<h3 class="author">ArcaneMusic updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">The entirety of hydroponics works again!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Plants can now Cross-Pollinate, via adjacency. This causes plant stats of average into each-other.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Plants now have a new stat, Instability. Instability allows for gradual mutations to a plant's stats at certain thresholds, and a chance of mutation, or gaining new random traits at even higher thresholds.</li>

			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">EOBGames (Inept) updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">A whole bunch of materials are now datumised! Check out bronze, runed metal, sand, sandstone, snow, paper, cardboard, bone and bamboo. Oh, and pizza. Yes, pizza.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Ryll/Shaps updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Adds stingbangs to cargo (and one in the sec vendor premium), premium less-lethal grenades that shoot off a giant swarm of stingball pellets to help incapacitate swarms of people in tight quarters. You can jump on top of a live one to be a hero and absorb a bunch of shrapnel, same with  frag grenades. There's even an achievement for dying to a grenade you jumped on!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Projectiles can now embed in people! Or at least grenade shrapnel and the new .38 DumDum ammo, now available in cargo, can. DumDum rounds excel against unarmored targets, but are pricey and do poorly against armored targets.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Bullets can now ricochet! Or at least, standard .38 and the new .38/L6 Match Grade ammo can. Match Grade ammo is finely tuned to ricochet easier and seek targets off bounces better, and can be purchased from cargo (for the .38) or nuke ops uplink (for the L6), but standard .38 ammo has a chance to ricochet as well.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Frag grenades now have smaller explosions but shoot off a bunch of devastating shrapnel, excellent for soft targets!</li>
				<li class="tweak">Shotguns and other multi-pellet guns now print aggregate messages, so you'll get one "You've been hit by 6 buckshot pellets!" rather than 6 "You've been hit by the buckshot pellet in the X!" messages. Bye bye lag!</li>
				<li class="balance">Armor can now protect against embedding weapons, taking the best of either the bullet or bomb armor for the limb in question away from the embed chance. Some weapons are better at piercing armor than others!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Due to pressure from various organizations, Nanotrasen is implementing a new ban on the purchase of alcohol and tobacco products for crewmembers under the age of 20 onboard its Spinward space stations. Please remember that providing alcohol or tobacco products to underage crewmembers is against Space Law, and remember to check those cards bartenders!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Standard Nanotrasen IDs now display the registered age of the holder, which you can change at the HoP's access console.</li>
